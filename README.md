# Macaca-Ninteract-evolution
This document record pipelines used when dealing with macaca Ninteract genes.

# Source of Data
Data used in the project come from 4 different sources:
  1. Wild caught samples in China (N=79)
  2. Laboratory strains from India (N=89)
  3. The stump-tailed macaque (N=10)
  4. A subspecies of longtail macaque, both of whose mitochondrial DNA is introgressed from a highly diverged ancestor (N=7)
